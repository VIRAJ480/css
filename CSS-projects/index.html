<h4>this is the tag selector which is not used mainly because when we have to use many tags or same tag at that time
    thier is disadvantage that it will not work properly
</h4>

<!-- id selector -->
<!-- The CSS id Selector
The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.

The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element!

To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element. -->
<!-- In Simple words when we have to give any unquie work to a worker of departments at that time we have to use id selector  -->

<h1 id="dep_1">here the head of dep one will do the only work of backend</h1>
<h1 id="dep_2">here the head of dep two will do the only work of backend</h1>
<h1 id="dep_3">here the head of dep three will do the only work of backend</h1>

<style>
    #dep_1
    {
        color: orange;
    }
    #dep_2
        {
        color: rgb(232, 242, 253);
    }
    #dep_3
    {
        color: rgb(4, 255, 0);
    }
</style>


<!-- class selector  -->
<!-- The CSS class Selector
The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute.
To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name. -->
<!-- in simple words when we have to give same work for different works at that time we have to use class selector  -->
<!-- class can be used single or multiply -->
<h6 class="worker">will do the work of frontend</h6>
