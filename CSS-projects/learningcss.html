/* CSS has properties for specifying the margin for each side of an element:

margin-top
margin-right
margin-bottom
margin-left
All the margin properties can have the following values:

auto - the browser calculates the margin
length - specifies a margin in px, pt, cm, etc.
% - specifies a margin in % of the width of the containing element
inherit - specifies that the margin should be inherited from the parent element */

/* The shortend property for margin is top,right ,bottom,left  that is TRBL*/

<!-- specificity 

The specificity mainly depends upon the rank or score of the selectors

-->

<!-- SO HERE the elements are given the specificty like this way 

Every CSS selector has its place in the specificity hierarchy.

There are four categories which define the specificity level of a selector:

1.Inline styles 
2.IDs - (id selector)
3.Classes, pseudo-classes, attribute selectors 
4.Elements and pseudo-elements 

-->

<!-- This is the above example which can tell you that All
you can uncomment and see that element -->
